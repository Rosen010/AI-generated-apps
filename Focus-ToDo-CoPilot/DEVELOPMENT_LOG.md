### Next Steps:
- Document key modules and logic flows

## Technical Decisions
1. Using vanilla JavaScript with ES6 modules
2. Express server for local development
3. CSS custom properties for theming
4. LocalStorage for data persistence (upcoming)

## Notes
- Server runs on http://localhost:3000
- Remember to run `npm install` and `npm start` to start development server
- VS Code must be restarted after Node.js installation
